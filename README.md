# Bihar-Election-2020
The data includes the past election results (Bihar Election 2020) at the assembly constituency level.

a. Determine the winning party for every election at the state level. A party which
has the highest total votes is considered the winner here.

b. determine the list of swing seats for the state. A swing seat is a constituency
which has a different winner in every election. The elections are held in the order
2005-Feb, 2005-Oct, 2010 and 2015.

c. Determine the top 8 parties at the state-level in each election in terms of getting
the most votes.

d. Determine the minimum votes that each party in the top 8 of the 2015 election
secured among all the past elections. Do this for all constituencies.

e. Determine the consistently tri-polar constituencies. I.e Constituencies in which 3
parties or more got greater than 10% of the vote shares in each election. The
parties can be different for different elections.

f. Determine the stronghold party-seats. A stronghold seat is one that is won by the
same party in all the elections.

g. Determine close contest constituencies. Close contest seats are those in which
the top 2 finishers had a difference of less than 10% votes. Find seats in which
there was a close contest in all the elections. If there is no such seat, then relax
the criteria to 15%.

h. Find the growing seats. For the top 8 parties at the state-level in the 2005-Feb
Election, Determine the seats in which these parties have continuously increased
their votes in the next 3 elections.

i. Find the declining seats. Repeat exercise g for the opposite growth.

j. Determine the state-winner-match constituencies. Find the seats which have
always elected the party that has gone on to win the state election (most votes
secured at state). So if the RJD won at the state level in 2010, then seats which
voted an RJD candidate as winner are considered in this category. This criteria
for a seat has to be matched for each election.
